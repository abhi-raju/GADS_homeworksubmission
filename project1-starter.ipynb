I will follow the calculation of the basic statistics with the creation of a box plot (as part of the exploratory analysis) in order to view a visual summary of the data, specific to the main descriptive statistics. I would then use the pandas functions for skewness and kurtosis in order to establish how my data is distributed about the mean, and how peaked my distribution is. Given these strategies, I will then have a good understanding of how my data is distributed."

    "Answer: I will test for colinearity by first judging the significance of the regression coefficient. If I expect the variable to be highly correlated with the independent variable, then I will make sure that the regression coefficient is equally, or at least sufficiently, significant. Another way to test for colinnearity is to see whether the regression coefficient is negative if the response/independent variable is expected to increase along with the dependent variable; and vice versa. I can also observe whether there is a pairwise correlation between the two X variables themselves. Lastly I can test for colinnearity by removing or adding dependent variable(s) and judging the degree of the effect on the regression coefficient."

The main risk with this problem statement is that there may still be other factors that have an influence on admittance into graduate school that this problem statement is not taking into account, and therefore, will not be able to factor these predictors into the prediction. Furthermore, the final prediction may not be entirely correct, due to missing information and insight surrounding key predictors that were not in the data. The data limits the predictors that can be used for this model, and that, in itself, imposes a risk. "
